# ETH-AVAX---FunctionFrontend

## Description
Instructions: For this project, create a simple contract with 2-3 functions. Then show the values of those functions in frontend of the application.

This project contains the program files of an ATM, written using Javascript and Solidity. The program uses React and Ethereum blockchain technology. The ATM enables users to connect their MetaMask wallets, view their account balance, deposit and withdraw funds based on the amount they input, as well as multiply and divide their balance by 2.

## Getting Started 

### Executing Program
1. In the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
6. Create a hardhat network in the MetaMask Netwok: http://127.0.0.1:8545/, 31337, ETH
  6.2 If you're using a virtual environment like Gitpod, use the port address as the RPC URL 
7. Copy one of the private keys that can be found in the second terminal, then click "Import Account" in the MetaMask and paste the private key.
8. You can now experiment and test it.
